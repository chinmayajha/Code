Hello
So you want to learn C++
OR Python if that fascinates you


So how much do you in programming
Do you know any other language? OR C++?

So here's the plan
We'll have a demo session of about 15-30 minutes
And if you like it we'll proceed further
The session would be on any conferencing app you like.
Skype, Zoom, Google meet, Discord, Microsoft teams any application you like
You could also have a recording of a past demo session I've had from a person from Ghana, we had trouble communicating but you'll get the idea of how this series is going to be

The Demo would be absolutely free, but if we DO proceed, it would cost something, and ANY amount you like.

I promise I will not bargain (please keep an appreciable amount as a fee though!)

How much would you rate today's session from 0-10
You might want to skip the first 5 minutes

Ok so here's the summary:
1. We have a meeting at 10AM Nigerian time on Zoom (i'll share the link)
of about 45-60 minutes
.
2. After the session, you rate the session from 0-10. 
.
3. If you like the session you complete the payment and we move on to the complete C++ series which should be done in 2-3 weeks depending on the student
